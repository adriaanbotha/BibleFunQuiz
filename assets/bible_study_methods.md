# Bible Study Methods for Kids

## Spiritual Foundation
**Key Scripture**: "So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." - Romans 10:17

All Bible study should be led by the Holy Spirit through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. As Jesus Himself said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6). He is the Word made flesh (John 1:14), and through Him we can understand and teach the Word effectively. The key to effective Bible study is relationship - relationship with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. As we develop this relationship, we learn to hear His voice and understand His Word more deeply.

Remember:
- Bible study is not just about knowledge, but about relationship
- The Holy Spirit is our teacher and guide
- Jesus is the Word and the way to understanding
- All study should be prayerful and Spirit-led
- The goal is to know Him, not just know about Him
